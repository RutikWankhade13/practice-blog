The principles are listed at random and some may even be conflicting, nevertheless, they’re all helpful and easily applied. Be a domain expert . Do you know how hard it is to produce working, quality software without being an expert in the business that you’re writing code for? You probably do know. Developers often work with businesses and domains they know nothing about. But let me tell you, domain expertise trumps technical knowledge in the majority of cases. Having only technical knowledge you’ll be able to do the wrong thing technically correct, which is worse than doing nothing.  Seek all the domain knowledge you can. Soak it up. Write it down. Keep it at hand, all the time.",

        discription: "I’ve been writing unit tests since I started coding professionally. There’s a certain “zen” to it. It forces you to think about what it’s like to be another developer that has to use your code. Even if that “other developer” is your future self. Whenever I write a unit test, I not only want to verify correctness, but I also try to assess the class’ ergonomics–the developer experience that the class provides. I think an increasingly important aspect of writing good code is to write code that is pleasant to work with. However, verifying overall system correctness is a trait that unit tests don’t possess. Writing unit tests is dirt cheap. They’re impressively fast to write, execute, and verify a desired outcome. However, they’re also cheap in another sense. Unit tests are rarely enough to catch actual bugs that are likely to happen in production.",

        discription: "1. Encryption vs. Hashing vs. Encoding Encryption is a process of scrambling data so that only authorized parties can unscramble it using a key. It is used to share sensitive information over non- secure communication channels. Hashing is a one - way transformation of data into a fixed - size string.Modern hashing techniques(e.g.SHA - 256) are impossible to reverse. Its use cases are: to verify the integrity of data (in version control software) to securely store passwords in a database in data structures such as hash tables Encoding is the process of converting data into a different format using a set of rules (e.g. ASCII or Unicode).",
